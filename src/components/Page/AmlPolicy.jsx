              <p>
                <strong>Objective of the Policy</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Fairbets.co is fully committed to be constantly vigilant to
                prevent money laundering and combat the financing of terrorism

                funding of terrorist and other criminal activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Obligations</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Appoint one of its senior officers as the designated Money
                  Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) whose responsibilities
                  will include the duties required by the laws regulations and
                  guidance notes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All instances of suspected Money Laundering attempts must be
                  reported to the MLRO, but that suspicion must not be conveyed
                  to the customer and further actions must await consents. The
                  MLRO is then&nbsp; responsible for liaising with, submitting
                  Suspicious Activity Reports and seeking consents from the
                  responsible legal authority in the jurisdiction where the
                  transaction was done, when appropriate. He will also ensure
                  that appropriate registers are kept for all related reporting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take reasonable steps to establish the identity of any person
                  for whom it is proposed to provide its service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fairbets will implement a FULL ‘Know Your Customer’ policy.
                  This will assist in tackling not just Money Laundering threats
                  but other fraud threats generally. Customers will be advised
                  at registration and&nbsp; generally on the supporting
                  non-transactional website that Company will utilize online
                  verification tools and that in instances where we are not able
                  to satisfy criteria, ID and address verification documents
                  will be&nbsp; requested.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep at all times a secure online list of all registered
                  Players.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Retain identification and transactional documentation as
                  defined in the laws regulations and guidance notes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The business will also not have any cash element to it,
                  mitigating risks associated with counterfeit monies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Systems will be operating to record all transactions for an
                  account. These account histories will be subject to a program
                  of regular and continual checks against fraud and social
                  responsibility indicators. Where&nbsp; unusual bet patterns
                  and winning patterns are detected, these will also be cross-
                  referenced to call history to ensure that staff are not
                  colluding with customers or acting illicitly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fairbets will also keep a register of those customers that it
                  identifiesas high risk or politically exposed. Those accounts
                  will be subject to greater scrutiny and frequency of checks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In general, where illegal or inappropriate behavior by staff
                  is identified, investigatory and disciplinary procedures will
                  follow those outlined in staff contracts as required by
                  employment law directives and the need to&nbsp; use in greater
                  propensity, measures such as suspension when for example
                  transactional fraud is suspected and those activities form a
                  standard part of an employee’s job description.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All transactions carried out on our site may be controlled to
                  avoid money laundering or terrorist financing activities.
                  Suspicious transactions will be reported to the relevant
                  authority, depending on the jurisdiction&nbsp; governing the
                  transaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If our risk and fraud department suspects fraud, it may
                  require the player to provide appropriate documentation. If
                  there is enough evidence of fraudulent behavior (eg bank
                  repudiation, account operated by third&nbsp; parties, use of
                  forged documents, fraud of means of payment, etc.), the
                  account will be suspended until the situation is cleared. The
                  suspension shall be communicated to the relevant authority
                  together with the&nbsp; respective grounds (evidence or
                  evidence collected) within 24 hours and to the authorities
                  responsible for criminal proceedings. Parallel to the
                  suspension, Fairbets may proceed to the immobilization, as
                  a&nbsp; precautionary measure, of the balance of the player
                  account, until the decision of the competent authorities.

                          us. Only when we determine some of the above points or
                          a combination of a few will we flag the&nbsp;
                          customer/customers in question and conduct risk
                          monitoring. This will include checks of where the
                          customer works, value of house, where the customer
                          lives and checks to see whether the value of the house

                deposit, the customer can use the deposited funds for bets. The
                deposits are credited to the player’s account as soon as the
                bank&nbsp; transfer is successfully validated. Deposits and

                Casino Bonus Balance and Sportsbook Bonus Balance. The existence
                of two wallets (casino and sports betting) does not change the
                behavior of your player account when making an withdrawal
                request. Consequently, making a request of&nbsp; withdraw,
                regardless the balance to be withdrawn is transferred from your

                withdrawals, these must be made by bank transfer to the account
                given by the user when they registered or to the&nbsp; payment
                account they indicatedand hold and that is chosen for this
                purpose. Withdrawals may only be processed from your Sports Cash
                Account. Any withdrawals from your Casino Cash Account can only
                be made by&nbsp; first transferring your withdrawal amount to
                your Sports Cash Account and then requesting the withdrawal be
                processed from the Sports Cash Account. Please note however that
                any transfer of funds from the Casino&nbsp; Cash Account to the
                Sports Cash Account will be considered a Withdrawal from the
                Casino Cash Account and may consequently result in the
