                <strong>Commitment to Preventing Underage Gambling</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                A core aspect of fairbets.co’s Responsible Gaming program is the
                prevention of underage gambling. Players must present either a
                valid driver’s license, national ID, passport, or any valid ID
                to register and wager at the fairbets.co sports book website.
              </p>
              <p>
                fairbets.co will verify the player’s identity using a Know Your
                Customer (KYC) process. If data is validated and the customer is
                confirmed to not be on a self-exclusion list and is over the
                legal age to gamble in that jurisdiction, the account set up is
                approved. If the KYC process fails to validate the customer, an
                alert message is sent to fairbets.co’s customer service team who
                will contact the requesting customer to provide the necessary
                information to validate identity, etcetera.

                  fairbets.co encourages parents and concerned adults to talk to

              </p>
              <p>
                Begin a meaningful dialogue about the risks of gambling. It’s
                never too early to start the conversation about gambling and its
                risks. By opening a dialogue, concerned adults can help ensure
                that kids are better prepared to make responsible choices now
                and throughout their lives.

              </p>
              <p>
                The players must ensure that their account information is
                secure. Parents and other concerned adults should be mindful of
                the possibility that kids can access their accounts and
                passwords or use credit cards and personal information to create
                a fraudulent account.
